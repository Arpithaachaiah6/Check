A quintessential component of any type of landslide susceptibility map (LSM), risk assessment, and identifying the role of influencing parameters is the creation of a landslide inventory map (LIM). It helps to analyse the spatial and temporal characteristics of the landslides and is also vital for constructing a landslide early warning system. Thus, LIM and LSM play a vital role in landslide disaster risk reduction. As a paradigm work, this study aims at creating a relatively complete landslide inventory dataset for 2018 rainfall-triggered landslide in a small sector of the south of the Western Ghats, called Kodagu in Karnataka, India. Integration of field investigation, and visual interpretation of pre- and post-landslide images of the Google Earth and Sentinel-2A were used to construct this LIM. Field investigation was aimed at two components: to verify the created inventory from imageries and to map those landslides that could not be identified in the images due to non-availability of images or cloud covered images or for any other reasons. The LIM comprises 17,267 landslides - 89 from field investigation, 178 from imagery interpretation. Of these, 153 are shallow slides, and 114 are debris flow, with major damages attributed to debris flow. But the majority of the destruction was confined to debris flow. On correlation with influencing factors, the noteworthy characters identified are 14°-29° slope, moderately dissected hills and valleys, and pediment-pediplain complex type geomorphology, garnet-sillimanite-gneiss+graphite+cordierite lithology and forest land use category (both forest and mixed forest plantation) has the maximum landslide occurrences.
